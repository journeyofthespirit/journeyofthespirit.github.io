			<p id="home">This blog is an account of my journey from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. I've decided against doing this chronologically: if I try to recall each detail in the order it happened, I'm afraid that I'll focus too much on the "whens and wheres" of my story instead of the underlying message. I think that my words will come more naturally by writing about topics, ideas, and stories as they come to mind. </p>
			
			<p>I've found that understanding (or a revelation, or knowledge...call it what you like) rarely comes linearly. That is, it seems that some of life's most significant realizations dawn on us only after we've acquired all the necessary pieces, looked at them from different angles, and with a sudden gasp we finally see how everything fits together.   </p>
