			<p id="home">This blog is an account of my journey from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. I've decided against doing this chronologically: if I try to recall each detail in the order it happened, I'm afraid that I'll focus too much on the "whens and wheres" of my story instead of the underlying message. I think that my words will come more naturally by writing about topics, ideas, and stories as they come to mind. </p>
			
			<p>I've found that understanding (or a revelation, or knowledge...call it what you like) rarely comes linearly. That is, it seems that some of life's most significant realizations dawn on us only after we've acquired all the necessary pieces, looked at them from different angles, and with a sudden gasp we finally see how everything fits together.   </p>

			<h3 id="about">About</h3>
			
			<p>My name is Justin Thompson. I went into the army right after high school. I was an infantryman for five and a half years, two of which were spent in Iraq (03-04 and 06-07). After the army I got a BS in mathematics from the University of Washington. I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. I'd wondered from chemistry to biochem and neurobiology and finally settled on mathematics. I didn't have any career goals. I wasn't in college because I wanted to be a such-and-such; I was searching for truth and whaddya know, I wasn't finding it in the ivory tower. </p>
			
			<p> At the end of my ... was awarded two scholarships through the <a href="http://www.csne-erc.org/">CSNE</a> to do postbaccalaureate research. I started a Ph.D. program with the applied mathematics department at UW, but quickly decided that research (and academia in general) was not for me.

				<p>The partially-shown icon at the top of this page depicts St John the Baptist, Angel of the Desert (17th Century, Russian). The <a href="img/SaintJohnTheBaptist.jpg">full image</a> was obtained <a href="https://iconreader.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/why-does-john-the-baptist-have-wings-in-orthodox-icons/">here</a>.</p>
