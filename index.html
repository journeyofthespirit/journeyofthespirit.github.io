			<p id="home">This blog is an account of my journey from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. To be more precise, it's about my journey from a lukewarm Baptist/non-denominational upbringing, to a half-hearted attempt at "faith" in a new-agey, Jesus-was-just-a-great-teacher-if-he-even-existed-at-all kind of way, through atheism (where I wallowed for 11 years), then back to Christianty, but I wasn't sure in what sense. </p>
			
			<p>I've decided against doing this chronologically: if I try to recall each detail in the order it happened, I'm afraid that I'll focus too much on the "whens and wheres" of my story instead of the underlying message. Nothing would get posted if I spent my time trying to organize the last fifteen to twenty years. I think that my words will come more naturally by writing about topics, ideas, and stories as they come to mind.</p>
			
			<p>I've found that understanding (or a revelation, or knowledge...call it what you like) rarely comes linearly. That is, it seems that some of life's most significant realizations dawn on us only after we've acquired all the necessary pieces, looked at them from different angles, and with a sudden gasp we finally see how everything fits together.   </p>

			<p>My name is Justin Thompson. I went into the army right after high school. I was an infantryman for five and a half years, two of which were spent in Iraq (03-04 and 06-07). After the army I got a BS in mathematics from the University of Washington. I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. I'd wondered from chemistry to biochem and neurobiology and finally settled on mathematics. I didn't have any career goals. I wasn't in college because I wanted to be a such-and-such; I was searching for Truth and whaddya know, I wasn't finding it in the ivory tower. Don't get me wrong: mathematics is a powerful tool for studying, describing, and playing with truth, but studying mathematics -- at least in the modern university setting -- won't necessarily lead to Truth (with a capital T). </p>
			
			<p> At the end of my senior year I ran into an old professor of mine  purely by accident, as I had changed paths that day in an unprecedented break from my usual routine. While talking he asked what my plans were after graduation. If I recall correctly, I laughed and said I had no idea. He told me about a scholarship program through the <a href="http://www.csne-erc.org/">CSNE</a> to do postbaccalaureate research. I did that for about a year, had a wonderful time, met some amazing people, and thought that I could -- perhaps -- enjoy a life of research in applied mathematics. </p>
			
			<p>I started a Ph.D. program with the applied mathematics department at UW, but quickly decided that research (and academia in general) was not for me. Of course my decision to leave grad school wasn't determined by one particular thing, but an event occured that eventually led to a realization about myself which I could not overlook.
