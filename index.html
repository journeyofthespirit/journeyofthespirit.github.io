			<p id="home">This blog is an account of my journey from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. To be more precise, it's about my journey from a lukewarm Baptist/non-denominational upbringing, to a year-long, half-hearted attempt at "faith" in a new-agey, Jesus-was-just-a-great-teacher-if-he-even-existed-at-all kind of way, through eleven years of atheism<sup><a href="#note_1" id="1note">Note [1]</a></sup>, then slowly back to Christianty. Although I don't like to say, "<i>back</i> to Christianity," because the faith and understanding I have now is so radically different from what I had in my youth, and I pray that this growth continues eternally. </p>
			
			<p>I've decided against doing this chronologically: if I try to recall each detail in sequence, I'm afraid that I'll focus too much on the "whens and wheres" of my story instead of the underlying message. Nothing would get posted if I spent my time trying to organize the last fifteen to twenty years. I think that my words will come more naturally by writing about topics, ideas, and stories as they come to mind.</p>
			
			<p>I've found that understanding (or knowledge, or a revelation...call it what you like) rarely comes linearly. That is, it seems that many of life's most significant realizations dawn on us only after we've acquired all the necessary pieces, looked at them from different angles, and with a sudden gasp we finally see how everything fits together.   </p>
		
			<p>With that analogy in mind, the point of this blog is not to show you my puzzle; there are still a lot of missing pieces and I probably have some of them jammed into places they really don't fit. I'm not claiming that the puzzle I'm working on --the image I'm assembling, the journey I'm taking-- is the right one for you. My intent is to share what pieces I've found in hopes that one or two of them might fit in your puzzle. I pray that these pieces help you and comfort you on your own spiritual journey.</p>

			<h3 id="about">About</h3>
			
			<p>My name is Justin Thompson. I went into the army right after high school. I was an infantryman for five and a half years, two of which were spent in Iraq (03-04 and 06-07). After the army I got a BS in mathematics from the University of Washington. I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. As an undergraduate I'd wondered from chemistry to biochem and neurobiology and finally settled on mathematics. I didn't have any career goals. I wasn't in college because I wanted to be a such-and-such; I was searching for Truth and whaddya know, I wasn't finding it in the ivory tower. Don't get me wrong: mathematics is a powerful tool for studying, describing, and playing with truth, but studying mathematics --at least in the modern university setting-- won't necessarily lead to Truth. </p>
			
			<p> At the end of my senior year I ran into an old professor of mine  purely by accident, as I had changed paths that day in an unprecedented break from my usual routine. While talking he asked what my plans were after graduation. If I recall correctly, I laughed and said (with colorful language) that I had no idea. He told me about a scholarship program through the CSNE<sup><a href="#note_2" id="2note">[2]</a></sup> to do postbaccalaureate research. I did that for about a year, had a wonderful time, met some amazing people, and thought that I could --perhaps-- enjoy a life of research in the world of applied mathematics. </p>
			
			<p>I started a Ph.D. program with the applied mathematics department at UW, but quickly decided that research (and academia in general) was not for me. Of course my decision to leave grad school wasn't determined by one particular thing, but an event occured that led to a realization about myself which I could not overlook.</p>
				
			<p>In December 2014 the Senate Committee's Report<sup><a href="#note_3" id="3note">[3]</a></sup> on the C.I.A.'s use of torture was released to the public and I exploded. I wrote an impassioned open letter to President Obama and shared it with everyone I knew (another piece for another time). I quit going to classes completely (I had already been blowing off grad school). I was burning with anger at our government and with the world: a government exonerating sociopathic brutality and a society without enough empathy to care. </p>
			
			<p>I'd learned many hard lessons in my five and a half years in the army. The most important one came from the following facts. I signed my four-year contract to be an army infantryman in July 2001. I completed my final year of high school and shipped out in June 2002. The buildup to the Iraq war never sat well with me. I did not believe that we were being told the truth about Saddam's regime, their ties with terrorists, their alleged weapons of mass destruction, and so on. These feelings were later vindicated<sup><a href="#note_4" id="4note">[4]</a></sup> beyond any doubt, ironically, in the wake of the torture report. But my entire time in Iraq only confirmed for me that Operation Iraqi "Freedom" had very little to do with liberating an oppressed people. Through all of this, I felt as though I had participated in a war that I knew in my heart was wrong. </p>
			
			<p>I didn't join the army because we'd been attacked on 9/11 and I wanted revenge. I joined because both of my parents had served in the army, and part of me always knew I wanted to have that experience under my belt too. I had many personal reasons for wanting to join; some immature, some selfish, but ultimately, they were guided by a sense of duty. And even though I was vehemently against the war in Iraq --something my chain of command was <i>well</i> aware of-- I participated in two tours because I had a duty to my friends in my unit. </p>
			
			<p>With all of that in mind, the most important lesson I learned can be summed up as a piece of advice I've given to people who've told me that they were considering working for the NSA, CIA, or military: <i>be very careful and think very hard about your decision because you may end up in a situation where you will have to do things that you find to be morally reprehensible. You may or may not be able to deal with the consequences of your actions. And you do NOT know NOW whether or not your future self is capable of dealing with those consequences.</i> Even with the best of intentions your actions may have malignant results. This is a very important piece of truth for me; one that I thought I had taken to heart. </p>
			
			<p>Starting college immediately after the army was a great way to run away from all of the emotional baggage I'd accumulated over the years. I had an overwhelming hatred for war, money, power, and for societies of people who regularly sit by and accept these institutions as the status quo. I still struggle with this today, but now I'm actively working on it and I acknowledge that those feelings exist. I found in college that rigorous and regimented study can be a wonderful distraction from all of those larger problems you have crashing around inside of your head. It's easy to convince yourself that everything's fine if you're making great grades and only binge-drinking on the weekends. </p>
			
			<p>I was able to keep that veil in place for years, comfortably separating my emotional convictions from my conscious mind, and probably would have been able to do so for decades if it weren't for the pain and the sense of injustice I felt once the truth about our nation's torture program came to light. As the veil fell, I was able to see how blind I'd become. I realized that I had actually been considering applying for a DARPA<sup><a href="#note_5" id="5note">[5]</a></sup> research grant. It's not that I had an application in mind for national defense. It's just that my advisor and some mentoring professors had explained that applying for all kinds of grants and scholarships is "just what you did" in grad school and that as a vet, I would have a decent chance with federal funding, especially in the defense area. The part that horrified me was realizing that I had <i>just gone along with it</i> without giving any thought to possible ramifications of my actions. I was voilating my most sacred lesson.</p>
			
			<p>Again, it's not that the research I was working on was directly applicable to the defense industry (although it <i>definitely</i> could have been used that way). I think it's likely that I would come to my senses if I were granted a DARPA fellowship and noticed that my work was obviously evil. And it's not that defense research is wrong or that all of the fruits of DARPA are spoiled. It's that before I left the army, I had promised myself to <i>be very careful and think very hard about my decisions because I may or may not be able to deal with their consequences</i>. And in refusing to drop the veil and look into my heart, I was able to forget that promise, or at least, I was able to blur my vision to the point where I could convince myself that I was being true to myself, when in fact I wasn't.</p>
			
			<p>This realization woke me up and was the event that reintroduced me to my heart, and thus, began my journey back to God.</p>

			<h4>Notes</h4>
			<p id="note_1"><a href="#1note">[1]</a>&nbsp;When I say "atheism," I'm not talking about that petty, self-righteous, "angry at God," reactionary atheism. You know the type I mean. It's the type which assumes that if a loving or good God exists, then bad things shouldn't happen. And since "bad" things happen, then either God must not exist, or God can not be loving nor good. I'll have plenty to say about this faulty argument later, but now it suffices to say that I was a materialist and a positivist: I thought that physical existence was all that there was, and that <i>if</i> something <i>did</i> exist which was beyond our physical sensing capabilities, present or future, then such a thing or phenomenon <i>certainly</i> was of no consequence. I believed that religion was invented by man to explain the natural world, and that science was the light that would rectify our immature superstitions. I say this to be clear: I didn't run away from God because of some religious problem I couldn't wrap my head around. I wasn't angry at God. I simply did not think that such an entity existed. I thought that the odds were that <i>if</i> a being <i>did</i> create the universe, then it was most likely created as some kind of experiment or simulation. I thought that such an entity, if it existed at all, probably didn't know or care about our tiny human race aside from what data it would collect from the experiment or simulation. But at any rate, I didn't give the caring creator scenario any real credence. I thought it was most likely the case that we were just a collection of atoms, our consciousness merely an artifact of a highly complex system of deterministically-firing neurons. I believed that we were just matter, and therefore, nothing we did, said, or believed really mattered. Pretty convenient philosophy, huh?</p>
