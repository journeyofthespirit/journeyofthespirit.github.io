			<p id="intro">In my mind I've affectionately called this "the parable of the dog and the bacon." It just came to me one day in the kitchen. I think that it's a pretty good way of describing my worldview (universeview? omniview?). It is -- as all analogies are -- imperfect and incomplete. And that's kind of the point. </p>

			<p>So you're cooking bacon. You look down to see your dog's pathetic eyes and think, "oh, why not?" You give in, cut off a piece, and set it aside to cool. Now, your dog is a little rambunctious and can't sit still to save his life. He hops up on his hind legs (as soon as you're not looking, of course), licks up the piece you set aside for him, and burns his mouth. </p>
			
			<p>Let's say that this happens a few times over the course of a couple of months. Let's also suppose that your dog is astute enough to observe this cause-and-effect relationship going on: FOOD and STOVE implies HOT. I make this point because not all dogs have the capacity to learn this. There are some dogs who, no matter how many ways and times you try, will never learn to sit or stay, even if it is to their detriment. There's also the class of dogs who may learn to trust your guidance and obey when you say "wait for it," but still not comprehend the action "STOVE makes FOOD HOT." For the sake of this idea we'll say your dog is exceptionally gifted. He not only understands that the cold meat comes out of the fridge, goes on the pan on the stove, starts to smell really good, sizzles for what seems like an eternity, and becomes very HOT, but he also gets that you're setting it aside so that it won't be HOT anymore. </p>
