			<h1>The Dog and the Bacon</h1>
			
			<p id="intro">In my mind I've affectionately called this "the parable of the Dog and the Bacon." It just came to me one day in the kitchen. I think that it's a pretty good way of describing my worldview (universeview? omniview?). It is -- as all analogies are -- imperfect and incomplete. And that's kind of the point. </p>

			<p>So you're cooking bacon. You look down to see your dog's pathetic eyes and think, "oh, why not?" You give in, cut off a little piece, and set it aside to cool. Now, your dog is a little rambunctious and can't sit still to save his life. He hops up on his hind legs (as soon as you're not looking, of course), licks up the piece you set aside for him, and burns his mouth. </p>
