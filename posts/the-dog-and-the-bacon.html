			<h1><p id="title">The Dog and the Bacon</p></h1>
			
			<p id="intro">This is an analogy I came up with while thinking about scientific rationalism, God, epistemology, and cooking on the stove. It is -- as all analogies are -- imperfect and incomplete. And that's kind of the point. </p>
			
			<hr><br>
			
			<p>So you're cooking bacon. You look down to see your dog's pathetic eyes and think, "oh, why not?" You give in, cut off a piece, and set it aside to cool. Now, your dog is a little rambunctious and can't sit still to save his life. He hops up on his hind legs (as soon as you're not looking, of course), licks up the piece you set aside for him, and burns his mouth. </p>
			
			<p>Let's say that this happens a few times over the course of a couple of months. Let's also suppose that your dog is astute enough to observe this cause-and-effect relationship going on: FOOD and STOVE --> HOT. I make this point because not all dogs have the capacity to learn this. There are some dogs who, no matter how many ways and times you try, will never learn to sit or stay, even if it is to their detriment. There's also the class of dogs who may learn to trust your guidance and obey when you say "wait for it," but still can not comprehend the phenomenon, "STOVE makes FOOD HOT." For the sake of this argument we'll say your dog is exceptionally gifted. He not only understands that the cold meat comes out of the fridge, goes on the pan on the stove, starts to smell really good, sizzles for what seems like an eternity, and becomes very HOT, but he also gets that you're setting it aside so that it won't be HOT anymore. </p>
			
			<p>I don't think it's too far a stretch of the imagination to assume that there are dogs who have this cognative capability. It stands to reason, then, that your dog may have some rudimentary idea of heating and cooling. Who knows what's <i>actually</i> going on his mind? Perhaps after you set the piece aside he reasons, "FOOD is HOT...HOT...I RUN then I am HOT. I SIT. I PANT. Then I am COOL. Hmm...so...COLD FOOD must RUN on the STOVE, gets HOT, HUMAN sets it aside to SIT and COOL...OH! So that I don't BURN on HOT FOOD!" </p>
			
			<p>This is where it get interesting. As silly as the dog's line of reasoning may sound, it's not exactly wrong. When we take bacon out of the fridge, the reason we call it "cold" is that, on the atomic level, the atoms aren't moving very fast relative to eachother. Water is liquid because the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are moving around very quickly. If we put this water in the freezer, the molecules slow down until they get to a point where they no longer slide past each other and it becomes a solid, which we call ice. Contrary to what your teacher told you, the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in ice have <i>not stopped moving</i>! The molecules might not be flying past each other, but they're each shaking, or vibrating in place. It's only when the temperature of a substance reaches absolute zero that all motion stops (and good luck finding anything in the universe at, or getting anything to absolute zero). </p>
			
			<p>The same is true for all solids: if it ain't at absolute zero, its constituent molecules are in motion. And really, what we call temperature is just a measure of this motion. The reason that the frying pan is hot is because its atoms are moving, vibrating, pushing back and forth against each other (imagine rubbing your hands together on a cold day, only your hands are the atoms in the frying pan). Put the bacon in the pan and that energy of motion is transferred to the molecules of the bacon. Those constituent molecules begin to move faster with respect to one another. That's heat. You see, the dog was not wrong. The cold food becomes hot on the stove because it starts running around, well, its molecules are running around.</p>
			
			<p>So we've argued for --and I think we've pretty well established-- the idea that there are some dogs who have the capacity to understand cooling in some internal, relatable sense. I'm taking some liberties in assuming that they can grasp that next step, the "HUMAN did X for MY benefit," but that's not the focus right now. It stands to reason that some dogs may be able to understand cooling in a way which, however immature and rudimentary it may seem, is completely functional for the dog and is, almost paradoxically, still very true.</p>
			
			<p>Science uses mathematics to construct models, or mathematical descriptions of our physical universe. These models are our way of making sense of the physical world. One of the (many) models we have for cooling is Newton's law of cooling. It illustrates for us the relationship between how fast the temperature of a substance changes in relation to the temperature of its surroundings. We could use it to predict that taking the food out of the pan will cause the food's temperature to drop to room temperature after some number of seconds. Your dog's mental image of bacon doing laps around the frying pan and then panting-off heat after coming to rest is his model of the cooling phenomenon. It may lack the sophistication of formal mathematics, but the idea is there in his mind: if the bacon stops running, it will rest, pant and get cool eventually. </p>
			
			<p>While some dogs may be able to construct an internal model of cooling, I say that no dog has the capacity to understand the model we obtain from Newton's law of cooling, let alone comprehend its symbolic mathematical representation on a piece of paper. Dogs just aren't cut out for symbolic reasoning. Indeed there are few humans who have this kind of grasp on mathematics and physics. Fewer still are those who know that Newton's law of cooling doesn't really apply to this situation and falls painfully short of giving us an insightful model here. In order to construct an accurate model of a cooling piece of bacon --a model which would not only help us predict the temperature at a future time, but would also aid in our understanding of the phenomenon of cooling-- we would have to account for the bacon's chemical composition. We'd have to acknowlegde the fact that a piece of bacon is an inhomogeneous mix of proteins, carbohydrates, water, fats, and so on. </p>

			<p>Now choose any one of those proteins, say, hemoglobin. In creating a model for how heat denatures, or warps, this <i>one</i> protein, you could easily do enough work to earn a Ph.D. at a university. And depending on which field or framework you choose for attacking this problem (i.e. structural biochemistry, applied or pure math, biophysics, dynamical systems, finite element methods, ... ), you could easily spend a lifetime refining, studying, and learning that you've only scratched the surface of the underlying physical reality you're trying to describe. So, when it comes to the question, <i>"how well do we understand a concept or phenomenon?"</i>, the answer is <i>"how deep to you want to get?"</i></p>

<!--OLD STUFF-->

<!--			<p>I argue now that there is no dog who can understand Newton's law of cooling. I'll say that no dog has the capacity to understand a symbolic representation of a dynamic physical phenomenon (a differential equation) what it means, or how to solve it. The same could be said for most people. If you don't know, "solving" a "differential equation" gives you a "model", or a means of describing and making predictions about physical reality. (The equation itself is also called a model.) Solving Newton's law of cooling gives us a means of predicting what the temperature of something will be in the future. But it's not necessary for us, nor the dog, to have such thorough, analytical knowledge of cooling in order to understand it. And as it turns out, even complete theoretical knowledge of Newton's law won't help much here because it doesn't really apply to in this situation: the surface of a strip of bacon is not homogeneous. You could use it to calculate how long it would take, in theory, for your bacon to cool to an enjoyable temperature, but you could not guarantee that the results would be accurate. That is, your model of the bacon as a heat-loosing body in Newton's sense is insufficient to accurately describe the true process of cooling. </p>-->
