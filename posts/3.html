			<p id="intro">The Prophet Nahum had Elkesaeus (Elkosh) as his homeland, and was from the tribe of Symeon; he is seventh in order among the twelve Minor Prophets He prophesied during the time of Hezekias, after the destruction of Samaria (721 years before Christ), but before the ten tribes were taken into captivity; he prophesied against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. His name means "comforter." His book of prophecy is divided into three chapters. </p>

			<p>So you're cooking bacon. You look down to see your dog's pathetic eyes and think, "oh, why not?" You give in, cut off a piece, and set it aside to cool. Now, your dog is a little rambunctious and can't sit still to save his life. He hops up on his hind legs (as soon as you're not looking, of course), licks up the piece you set aside for him, and burns his mouth. </p>
